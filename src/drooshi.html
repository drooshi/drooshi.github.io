        <h2>Drooshi.tk celebrates 4th birthday!</h2>
        <p>Since January 2014, drooshi.tk has provided an immersive Drooshi experience for all. Years have passed, and drooshi.tk has received numerous updates. Today, we announce a special 4th anniversay edition of drooshi.tk, with a special message from the original author.</p>
        <p class="footer-quote">During December of 2014, I spent a lot of time listening to the song "Dragostea Din Tei". When, towards the end of the break, I created an animated GIF of a dancing drooshi, represented by a Mega Mushroom from the Super Mario series, it seemed only natural to pair the drooshi's slow, repetitive movement with the song. As such, the first version of drooshi.tk, written in plain HTML and hosted out of a Dropbox Public folder, was born. Shortly after, additional variations of the song were added to the original HTML site. Though multiple  experimental version of drooshi.tk were developed, this simple HTML 3-song version of the website remained online until I failed to renew its domain two years later. With Version 4, I've handed the project over to its current maintainer, and the drooshi is still dancing, all these years later.</p>
